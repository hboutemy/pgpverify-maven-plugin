Introduction
============

This plugin allows you to automatically verify PGP signature of all project dependencies.

Features
--------

 - check signature of artifacts during each build,
   not only during artifact download from the remote repository to local
 - possibility to map PGP key fingerprint to artifacts, so we can detect if correct key was used for making signature
 - possibility to check signature of maven plugins used during build
 - there is no external software need to install - plugin uses Bouncy Castle library to manage PGP operations
 - works on many operating system and JDK versions - confirmed by CI builds - Linux, Windows, Mac OS, JDK 8, 11, 14

Usage
-----

You can try it by running in your project directory:

    mvn ${project.groupId}:pgpverify-maven-plugin:check

or wherever you want in order to see information about a specific artifact:

    mvn ${project.groupId}:pgpverify-maven-plugin:show -Dartifact=junit:junit:4.12
